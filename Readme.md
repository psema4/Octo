[Octo](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/) is a high-level assembler for the [Chip8](http://mattmik.com/chip8.html) virtual machine, complete with an environment for testing programs. The Chip8 keypad is represented on your keyboard as follows:

	Chip8 Key   Keyboard
	---------   ---------
	 1 2 3 C     1 2 3 4
	 4 5 6 D     q w e r
	 7 8 9 E     a s d f
	 A 0 B F     z x c v

Command Line Mode
-----------------

The Octo assembler can also be used as a command-line tool via a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) frontend:

	$ ./octo
		usage: octo [--decompile] [--roundtrip] [--qshift]
			[--qloadstore] <source> [<destination>]
	$ cat simple.8o
		: main
			va := 1
			vb := 2
	$ ./octo simple.8o simple.ch8
	$ hexdump simple.ch8
		0000000 6a 01 6b 02                                    
		0000004

The `--decompile` option can be used to send an existing Chip8 binary through Octo's general-purpose decompiler.

Embedded Mode
-------------

Octo has a `share` feature which stores source code and configuration metadata in Github gists. Following one of these links will run the program and then you can back out into the Octo IDE. Alternatively, you can use these urls to embed a Chip8 emulator in an `iframe` on your websites:

	<iframe
		src="http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/embed.html?scale=2&gist=f3685a75817cde6d5c0d"
		width="256"
		height="128"
	></iframe>

(Special thanks to rmmh.)

The `scale` argument is optional and specifies the number of pixels which should make up a high-resolution mode Chip8 pixel. Low-resolution mode pixels will be twice this size.

UniCHIP8 Extensions
-------------------

This Octo fork provides compiler tokens for the opcodes defined by UniCHIP8; these are in the form of uc-<UniCHIP8 
opcode mnemonic>

See the UniCHIP8 folder in this repo for examples

See the UniCHIP8 project for more details on UniCHIP8

To compile a .u8o source file:

* ensure you have Node.js installed
* clone this repo to your filesystem
* cd into the Octo directory
* ./octo ./UniCHIP8/demo.u8o ./UniCHIP8/out/demo.uc8
